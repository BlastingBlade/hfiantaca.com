### scrcpy\_wifi.sh {#scrcpy-wifi-dot-sh}

An easy to use script to quickly establish a wireless video stream from android devices like the Oculus Quest.
Made for my sister to share her VR experiences with friends, and is simple enough that I can explain it to her.

The script can be found [here](/posts/scrcpy_wifi).


### powerfix.sh {#powerfix-dot-sh}

A quick hack to extend the life of an old charger to spite Dell.
Please do not ever run this script, it is not a good idea to do what this does.

More info can be found in a blog post [here](/posts/dell-power-fix).
